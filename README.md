#### Tips to keep passwords safe  
- If you are storing passwords in a database, use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.
- If you insist on using MD5 or SHA algorithms to hash password at a minimum use a salt.
- One goal when thinking of the hashing algorithm is to make it extremely difficult and time
  consuming for a threat actor to brute-force your password(s).
- Make 2FA mandatory.
